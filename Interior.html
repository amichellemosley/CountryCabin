<h3>This $33,000 House Takes Only 6 Hours to Construct</h3>
<iframe width="200" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/usbyJLOiFbE?rel=0&amp;controls=0;showinfo=0;autoplay=1;loop=1" " frameborder="0" "allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p> 
"They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but this house was. Or technically, a quarter of a day, since it goes up in about 6 hours".</p>
<p>
"How is it possible to assemble a $33,000 home so quickly? M.A.Di, which stands for "modulo abitativo dispiegabile," which roughly translates from Italian as "deployable modular housing," according to Geek.com, arrives at the construction site in pre-assembled panels. It's an A-frame house that begins with a crane lifting two hinged roof sections over the home's foundation, then standing them up in place". 
</p>
<p>
"From there it takes as few as three people to add on the rest of the house's parts. Watch the video above to see the progress in action".
</p>
<p>
"Because construction involves an "unfolding technique," the houses are customizable, expandable, and transportable. They come in five different plans, with the smallest one-bedroom unit covering 27 cubic meters, or roughly 96 square feet. The largest, a two-bedroom "cottage," is 70 cubic meters, or approximately 182 square feet, and costs about $74,000".
</p>
<p>
"The homes are also earthquake-resistant, making them ideal for affordable housing, temporary quarters for sports and other events, or medical facilities in the aftermath of natural disasters".
