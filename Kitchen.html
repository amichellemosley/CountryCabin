<h4>Add life to your kitchen with a tile backsplash. There are many options, such as mosaics on mesh backing or peel-and-stick tile, for easy installation.</h4></p>
<p>
<h3>
Here's how to install tile over drywall with tile adhesive.</h3>
</p>
<iframe width="300" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqwgemJKGp8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" align="middle" allow="autoplay"; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>
Plan the Tile Layout</p>
<p>
Tile backsplashes need a 1/8-inch expansion gap around the perimeter where the tile meets the cabinets and countertops.</p>
<p>
<h7>Step 1</h7></p>
<p>
Find the center of the wall that best suits your tile selection and mark a vertical line. Some tile patterns work best when centered on a focal point, such as the faucet or stove.</p>
<p>
<h7>Step 2</h7></p>
<p>
Dry lay tiles along countertop prior to installing on wall.</p>
<p>
Dry-lay tiles horizontally on the countertop along the wall using spacers to check the ends. If cut tiles will be too narrow, adjust the layout to allow you to cut wider pieces at both sides.</p>
<p>
<h7>Step 3</h7></p>
<p>
Find the lowest point of the countertop with a level across the top of the countertops.</p>
<p>
Check the vertical layout. Cut tiles are best hidden under cabinets, but you may have to cut from the bottom if your countertop isn't level.</p>
<p>
First, use a level to find the lowest point of the countertop. Hold a tile at this spot, accounting for a 1/8-inch expansion gap. Mark the wall at the top of the tile. Then, use a level to extend the line along the work area. This line serves as your cutting guide to fit tile along the counter.</p>
<p>
To see where the tile will end at the top of the installation, make a jury stick: Mark a straight board using the tiles and spacers for the vertical layout. Hold it up to the wall to check. If you have tiny slivers of tile at the top, adjust the layout down and redraw your reference line.</p>
<p>

Attach the Tile</p>
<p>
<h7>
Good to Know

Follow the manufacturer's instructions on mixing and drying times.</h7>
</P>
<p>
<h7>Step 1</h7>
Tile backsplash held into place with thinset on the wall.</p>
<p>
Mix thinset, or your chosen tile adhesive, according to directions and spread on a small section of the wall with a drywall trowel. It's important to work in small sections because thinset and other tile adhesives dry quickly. Comb over it with a notched trowel.</p>
<p>
Option 2: Peel-and-stick tile adhesive mats are also available that bond instantly to wall surfaces when pressed firmly with a grout float and allow you to tile and grout the same day, replacing traditional thinset and simplifying tile installation. Use the mats on clean, flat indoor surfaces such as backsplashes, countertops, and tub or shower walls. Avoid using them for floors, ceilings, fireplaces, steam rooms, shower floors, and surfaces that will be submerged in water. Mats don’t replace waterproofing products for tile. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation details. For more information, see Tile a Backsplash without Toil.</p>
<p>
Good to Know...
</p>
<p>
Use white thinset / adhesive for glass tile since it may show through.</p>
<p>
Caution</p>
<p>
Don't cover your layout reference lines with thinset / adhesive.</p>
<p>
<h7>Step 2</h7>
Pressing tile backsplash into the thinset with a tile float.</p>
<p>
Press the first piece of tile into the wall with a little twist, leaving a 1/8-inch expansion gap at the countertop. Press against it with a rubber float to seat it in the adhesive.</p>
<p>
<h7> Step 3 </h7>
Tile saw cutting piece of mosaic tile for backsplash.</p>
<p>
Working in small sections, repeat the procedure with additional pieces using spacers to ensure even spacing. If you need to make a cut, mark the tile. For larger tile cuts, set the tile in a tile cutter mesh side up, and score the face. Break each piece along the line. For smaller tile cuts, use nippers.</p>
<p>
<h7>Step 4</h7>
</p>
<p>
Bag of grout for finishing tile backsplash.</p>
<p>
Let thinset / adhesive dry for 24 hours, then mix grout according to directions.</p>
<p>

<p>
Use unsanded grout for gaps measuring less than 1/8 inch. Use sanded grout for gaps measuring more than 1/8 inch.</p>
