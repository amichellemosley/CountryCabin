Fully functional HTML webpage, with bootstrap and javascript embedded in. Also a seperate css sheet.
This website is aimed towards DIY home. There is minor content added just to give an idea of spacial layout. 
All videos and content is derived from another source. Content not referenced is from Lowe's and Homedepot's website. 
The javascipt code that is embedded into the html pages is for use of the sticky navigation bar and the slideshow viewer.
The bootsrap link is embedded into the html code to help strap your page. Initially I was doing an @allmedia to make the page responsive but after adding the bootstrap link it wasn't neccesary. 
The page is marked with <html lang="en"> but I do not have any reader built into the page.
